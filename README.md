# Community DCS-ExportScripts Library

---

## Overview

Yes, this repo is forked from https://github.com/asherao/DCS-ExportScripts, and our base repo is https://github.com/s-d-a/DCS-ExportScripts.

I am a DCS pilot and also a stream deck user, I think you too (LoL)

If you want to have fun controlling various aircraft in DCS using a Stream Deck, but without the traditional method of setting up hotkeys, here's what you need to do:
1. Get a stream deck of course. (Don't be stingy with your wallet, go for the XL version https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/stream-deck-xl)
2. Install the app of stream deck. (https://www.elgato.com/us/en/s/downloads)
3. Install the stream deck dcs interface plugin. (https://github.com/enertial/streamdeck-dcs-interface)
4. Setup the ExportScript from our repos, you can choose
   * [s-d-a's repo](https://github.com/s-d-a/DCS-ExportScripts), this is the original ExportScript repository, but it has stopped updating and few supported modules.
   * [asherao's repo](https://github.com/asherao/DCS-ExportScripts), successor to s-d-a's repo, modernized version of ExportScript (LMAO), it covers all modules in DCS and is an ongoing project.
   * My repo, here now. As I said, my repo is forked from [asherao's repo](https://github.com/asherao/DCS-ExportScripts), I added some personalized content, and merged Norsk_L's Script into my repo (I will selectively push these updates back to asherao's repo regularly), make their functions more complete and reasonable as much as possible.
5. Set profile on your stream deck. This process is tedious and boring, requiring you to constantly try out the functions provided by ExportScript and integrate them into your stream deck buttons. If you like to explore and do it yourself, just do it. If not, I recommend you to choose the profiles provided by Norsk_L and jonny415:
   * https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/files/filter/user-is-Norsk_L/apply/
   * https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/files/filter/user-is-jonny415/apply/
6. Run DCS, fly and fight!
